SmartRaahi: AI-Based Helmet Detection and Traffic Risk Prediction System
A unified AI platform integrating computer vision + machine learning for traffic monitoring, violation detection, accident prediction, and vehicle maintenance analysis.

Project Objectives
Predict road-accident likelihood using historical traffic, weather, and road-condition data.
Forecast traffic levels across junctions to reduce congestion.
Predict vehicle maintenance requirements for timely servicing.
Detect riders without helmets in images/videos and crop number plates.
Detect bikers crossing red-line boundaries.
Provide an integrated platform combining analytics, detection, and enforcement.
